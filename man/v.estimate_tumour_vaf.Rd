\title{Uses \code{deconvolute} to calculate adjusted tumour vaf as it would be if there were no host contamination
(vectorised over indicated parameters)}
\usage{
v.estimate_tumour_vaf(tumour_ref, tumour_alt, host_ref, host_alt, logr, purity)
}
\arguments{
\item{tumour_ref}{(vectorised) - number of REF reads observed in host-contaminated tumour, at current site}

\item{tumour_alt}{(vectorised) - number of ALT reads observed in host-contaminated tumour, at current site}

\item{host_ref}{(vectorised) - number of REF reads observed in matched host, at current site}

\item{host_alt}{(vectorised) - number of ALT reads observed in matched host, at current site}

\item{logr}{(vectorised) - log of ratio between tumour coverage and matched host coverage, at current site}

\item{purity}{(NOT vectorised) - Estimate of tumour purity (aka aberrant cell count)}
}
\value{
vector of VAF values
